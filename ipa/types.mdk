# Type System
~~ Notes
- IPA type lattice
	- Inconsistent ($\bot$)
	- `Rushed | Interval | Leased` 
	- Consistent ($\top$)
- Performance bounds
	- `Set[ID] with Consistency(Strong)`
	- `Set[ID] with LatencyBound(50 ms) -> contains(ID): Rushed[Boolean]`
	- `Counter with ErrorTolerance(5%) -> read(): Interval[Long]`
- Semantics of mixed consistency levels?
- Futures
	- (talk about how everything is implemented with futures, or just elide that?)
