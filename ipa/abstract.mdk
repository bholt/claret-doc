To keep users happy and meet service level agreements, web services must respond quickly to requests and be highly available. In order to always meet these tight performance goals, despite network partitions or server failures, developers often must give up strong consistency and migrate to some form of eventual consistency. Making this switch can be error-prone because the guarantees of weaker consistency models are notoriously difficult to understand and test. Furthermore, introducing weak consistency to handle worst-case scenarios creates an ever-present risk of inconsistency even for the common case, when everything is running smoothly.

In this work, we propose a new programming model for distributed data that uses types to provide a *disciplined* way to trade off consistency for performance safely. Programmers specify their performance and correctness targets as constraints on abstract data types (ADTs). Meeting performance targets introduces uncertainty about values, which are represented by a new class of types called *inconsistent, performance-bound, approximate (IPA)* types. We demonstrate how this programming model can be implemented in Scala on top of an existing datastore, Cassandra and used to make performance/correctness tradeoffs in two applications: a ticket sales service and a Twitter clone. Our evaluation shows that IPA's runtime system can enforce the programmer-specified performance and correctness bounds, achieving latencies comparable with weak consistency, 2--10$\times$ better than strong consistency under a variety of adverse conditions.
