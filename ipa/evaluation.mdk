# Evaluation

Distributed applications must be able to run in a constantly changing environment.  To evaluate IPA's ability to help programmers cope with extremes in performance, we answer the following questions in this section:

1. Do IPA's techniques meet the stated latency and error bounds under varying network conditions?
2. Can IPA enforce these bounds with reasonable overhead for a range of network conditions?
3. How do different bounds affect performance under different network conditions?

We answer these questions across varying network conditions by using a real-world testbed (Google Compute Engine [@GoogleCompute]) and simulating changing network conditions in a more controlled manner.  We begin using microbenchmarks on our simulated network to understand the performance of individual data types and explore each bound in isolation. Then, we move on to application benchmarks, modified to use IPA data types, on both our real-world and simulated test beds. 
<!-- IPA's types provide structure that helps programmers ensure their application handles all potential edge cases. The bounds specified by programmers give them control over how the application will adjust to changing conditions, but they also provide the system with hints about what it should prioritize, and release valves that allow it to still be useful even performance has degraded. [todo: make this text about what questions you want to answer with the evaluation. ] -->

## Simulating adverse conditions

To evaluate these bounding techniques, it is crucial to subject them to a variety of conditions. One typically has two two extreme choices when evaluating this kind of system: perform experiments in a controlled environment where latencies are typically very low and performance variability is negligible, or to throw them into a complex, real-world system, subject to the whims of unpredictable network conditions and resource sharing and try to piece together how they performed. A third option is to *simulate* a variety of environments, chosen to stress the system or mimic reality, within a more controlled environment. 

In our experiments, we employ all three to best understand how these techniques behave. On our own test cluster, with standard ethernet linking nodes within the same rack, we run controlled experiments, simulating adverse network conditions. We use Linux's Network Emulation facility [@netem] (`tc netem`) to introduce packet delay and loss at the operation system level. We use Docker containers [@docker] to enable fine-grained control of the network conditions between processes on the same physical node (`netem` is one of the properties isolated within the container).

[#tab-conditions] shows the set of conditions we use in our experiments to explore the behavior of the system. To simulate latencies within a well-provisioned datacenter, we have a *uniform 5ms* condition which is predictable and reliable but slower than our raw latency which is typically less than 1ms. Another condition demonstrates what happens when one replica is significantly slower to respond than the others either due to imbalanced load or hardware problems. Finally, we have two conditions mimicking globally geo-replicated setups with latency distributions based on measurements of latencies between virtual machines in the U.S., Europe, and Asia on Google Compute Engine [@GoogleCompute] and Amazon EC2 [@AmazonEC2].

## Microbenchmark: Counter
We start by measuring the performance of a very simple application that randomly increments and reads from a number of counters with different IPA policies. Random operations (`incr(1)` and `read`) are uniformly distributed over 100 counters from a single multithreaded client (using Scala futures to allow up to 4000 concurrent operations).

### Latency bounds

Latency bounds aim to provide predictable performance for clients while attempting to maximize consistency. Under favorable conditions — when latencies and load are low — it is often possible to achieve strong consistency. [#plot-counter-lbound] shows the average latency of a counter with strong, weak, and 2 latency-bounds under various conditions. We can see that there is a significant difference in latency between strong and weak. In these conditions, it is almost never possible to get strong consistency within 10ms, so the 10ms-bound counter predicts it will not get strong consistency and falls back to weak consistency. With a 50ms bound, the counter is able to get strongly consistent results if network latency is low. However, with one slow replica (out of 3), there is a chance that the `QUORUM` read needed for strong consistency will hit the slow replica, so IPA attempts both; in this case, 30% returned weak after the strong read timed out. Finally, with our simulated geo-replicated environment, there are no 2 replicas within 50ms of each other, so strong consistency is never possible; as a result, IPA adapts and only attempt weak reads in both cases.

Figure [#plot-counter-lbound-tail] shows the 95th percentile latencies of the same workload. We see that the tail latency of the 10ms bound is comparable to weak, though the 50ms bound guesses incorrectly occasionally for the case of the slow replica. We see a latency gap between the latency-bound and weak in the geo-distributed case. This is because the `weak` condition uses weak reads *and* writes, while our rushed types, in order to have the option of getting strong reads without requiring a read of `ALL`, must do `QUORUM` writes.

### Error bounds

We use the reservation system described in [#sec-error-bounds] to enforce error bounds,
which are a middle groud between strongly consistent reads and inconsistent reads that could return any value.
The goal of this experiment is to explore the empirical cost of enforcing error bounds, and to determine how tight error bounds can be while providing similar performance to weak consistency.

The intuition behind reservations is to move synchronization off the critical path: by distributing write permissions among replicas, clients can get strong guarantees while communicating only with a single replica. This shifts the majority of the synchronization burden off of reads, which are typically more common. However, this balance must be carefully considered when evaluating the performance of reservations, more so than the other techniques. When evaluating the latency bounds, we considered only read latency because we didn't change the writes. However, reservations actually slow down writes, so we must consider that effect.

[#fig-counter-err]a shows latencies for error bounds ranging from 0% to 10%, The *read* latency for error bounds is always equivalent to *weak*, so we plot the average of reads *and* increment operations combined to understand the overall performance. We can see that tighter bounds increase latency because it forces more synchronization operations, which must use consistency of `ALL`. Under high load we see higher variance in performance: if too many increments arrive together, some end up waiting for reservations. In most conditions, we see that 5-10% error bounds have comparable latency with weak, with the exception of the geo-distributed condition, where it seems that at least this implementation of reservations is not a good solution.

While we know that the error remains within our defined bounds, we may also wish to how much error occurs in practice compared to the bounds. We modified our benchmark to be able to observe the error resulting from weak consistency: using a single multi-threaded client, we keep track locally of how many increments to each counter we have done; then when we have completed a random, predetermined number of increments, we stop and read the count. The resulting error measurements are shown in [#fig-counter-err]b. We plot the percent error of weak and strong against the actual observed interval width for a 1% error bound, going from a read-heavy (1% increments) to a write-heavy (all increments, except to check the value).

First, we find that the *mean* error of weak is significantly less than 1%. This shows that inconsistency is quite rare; it is probably higher in practice when operations come from more than one client, but then we would not have been able to observe the error in the way we did. However, even with this experiment, we see outliers with significant error when writing is heavy: up to 60% error in the geo-replicated case. Finally, it is worth noting that the average interval width is less than the maximum of 1% and is lower for more read-heavy workloads that do not need as many reservations.

## Applications
Next, we explore how the IPA system performs on two application benchmarks in our simulated network testbed and on the geo-distributed, Google Compute Engine [@GoogleCompute]. We ran virtual machines on Google Compute Engine in 4 different datacenters: the client in `us-east`, and the datastore replicas in `us-central`, `europe-west`, and `asia-east`.

### Ticket service
Our Ticket sales web service, introduced in [#sec-background], is modelled after FusionTicket [@FusionTicket], which has been used as a benchmark in recent distributed systems research [@Xie:14:Salt;@Xie:15:ACIDAlt]. We support the following actions:

- `browse`: List events by venue
- `viewEvent`: View the full description of an event including number of remaining tickets
- `purchase`: Purchase a ticket (or multiple)
- `addEvent`: Add an event at a venue.

Event listings by venue are modelled using a `List` ADT. Tickets are modelled using a `Pool` type that generates unique identifiers as proof of purchase, using a `BoundedCounter` at its base to ensure that, even with weak consistency, it never gives out more than the maximum number of tickets.

Our workload attempts to model typical use of a small-scale deployment: we start with 50 venues and 200 events, with an average of 2000 tickets each (gaussian distribution centered at 2000, stddev 500). We chose the ticket to event ratio so that during the course of a run, we should have some events run out of tickets. This is important because the behavior of the `Pool` changes as it runs out of tokens (this is true for all bounds because the `BoundedCounter` has its own reservations for ensuring the lower bound, it is doubly true for the `Pool` with error bounds, which also has less margin for error at the end).
Real-world workloads exhibit power law distributions [@YCSB], where a small number of keys are much more popular than the majority. We model event popularity using a Zipf (power law) distribution with a coefficient of 0.6, which is moderately skewed.

[#plot-tickets] shows the average latency of a workload consisting of 70% `viewEvent`, 19% `browse`, 10% `purchase`, and 1% `addEvent`. We plot with a log scale because strong consistency is consistently over 5$\times$ higher latency. The `purchase` event, though only 10% of the workload, drives most of the latency increase because of the additional work required by the `BoundedCounter` to prevent over-selling tickets. We explore two different implementations: one with a 20ms latency bound on all ADTs, aiming to ensure that both `viewEvent` and `browse` complete quickly, and one where the ticket pool size ("tickets remaining") has a 5% error bound. We see that both perform with nearly the same latency as weak consistency. With the low-latency condition (*uniform* and *high load*), 20ms bound does 92% strong reads, 4% for *slow replica*, and all weak on both *geo-distributed* conditions.

This plot also shows results on Google Compute Engine *(GCE)*. We see that the results of real geo-replication confirm the findings of our simulated geo-distribution results (which were based on measurements of Amazon EC2's US/Europe/Asia latencies).

On this workload, we observe that the reservations used for the 5% error bound perform well even with high latency, which is different than our findings for the counter. This is because, in this case, the `Pool`s start out *full*, with sufficient reservations to be distributed among the replicas so that they can usually complete locally. Contrast this with the `Counter` experiments, where they start at typically smaller numbers (average initial value less than 500).

### Twitter clone

Our second application benchmark is a Twitter-like service based on the Redis data modelling example, Retwis [@retwis]. The data model is simple: each user has a `Set` of followers, a `Set` they users they follow, and a `List` of their tweets. Each user's timeline is kept materialized as a `List` of tweet IDs — when a user tweets, the new tweet ID is eagerly appended to all of their followers' timelines. Retweets are tracked with a `Set` of users who have retweeted each tweet. The retweet count, loaded for each tweet when a timeline is loaded, is represented in this ADT model by the size of the set.

Retweets are another good example of a place where error tolerance bounds faithfully represent an application-level correctness constraint. Most tweets by an average user on Twitter will have few retweets; in these situations, even a small error can be glaringly obvious: a user may get a notification, then look at the tweet and get frustrated when they cannot see the retweet. However, for a highly popular tweet that has been retweeted millions of times already, one more tweet does not need to be reflected immediately in the count. In fact, most views of Twitter will truncate large values to something like "3.4M", which is a perfect way to use an `Interval` result. Moreover, situations with massive numbers of retweets can be a performance bottleneck if not handled correctly, as Twitter learned when Ellen Degeneres's celebrity selfie brought it to a standstill at the 2014 Oscar's [@ellenselfie].
For the user's timeline, on the other hand, we do not need to know the size, but we do want it to load quickly to keep users engaged, so we use a latency bound. Finally, the follower list, which is changed infrequently, could be left as strongly consistent to ensure that new followers get all the latest tweets, but we want to keep performance as a priority, so use another latency bound, which gives us the option to warn the user if they may need to refresh to get more tweets.

Retwis doesn't specify a workload, so we simulate a realistic workload by generating a synthetic power-law graph, using a Zipf distribution to determine the number of followers per user. Our workload is a random mix with 50% `timeline` reads, 14% `tweet`, 30% `retweet`, 5% `follow`, and 1% `newUser`.

We can see in [#plot-twitter] that for all but the local (same rack) case, strong consistency is over 4$\times$ slower, but our implementation combining latency and error-bounds performs comparably with weak consistency, but with stronger guarantees for the programmer. Our simulated geo-distributed condition turns out to be the worst-case scenario for IPA's Twitter, with latency over 2$\times$ slower than weak consistency. This is because weak consistency performed noticeably better on our simulated network, which had one very close (1ms latency) replica that it could use almost exclusively.
