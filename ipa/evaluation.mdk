# Evaluation
[todo: explain how we simulate network conditions using `tc netem` and `docker` üê≥]

## Microbenchmarks
~~ Notes
- Latency bound
	- show how it can meet various latency bounds, compared with Strong and Weak
	- show that 95th percentile still meets latency bound!
	- show how many achieved stronger consistency, and how that correlates with actual consistency violations
- Reservations
	- show link between tighter bounds and lower performance
	- tie performance to the number of strong reads/reservation refreshes we had to do
	- show how interval width gets smaller with fewer writes
~~

## Applications
### Shopping Cart
[todo: demonstrate loading cart with a latency bound, but not allowing users to check out without doing a strong read]

### TicketSleuth
[todo: ticket sales app demonstrating hard lower bounds on counters]

### Twitter clone
[todo: demonstrating error tolerance for Counter (number of retweets), and latency bound for loading the timeline]
