# Conclusion
To navigate the treacherous seas of the Internet, today's distributed applications must be ready to cut through the waves of contention. Many capable techniques, like abstract locks, escrow, and consistency-based SLAs, are on hand, but the ship that holds them together is the abstraction afforded by ADTs. 
ADTs give programmers a powerful way to express application semantics by construction; IPA types allow them to trade off performance for precision in a disciplined way.
Rather than battening down the hatches just to stay afloat, by adjusting the sails just right to handle the gusts, applications can sail on through the storm.
