# Conclusion

Claret mitigates contention in real-world workloads by allowing programmers to expose application-level semantics with ADTs, which the datastore leverages in the transaction protocol and client library. These optimizations lead to significant speedups for transactions in high contention scenarios, without hurting performance on lighter workloads, making them competitive with non-transactional performance.
