# Conclusion

Reading is easy. If all applications were purely browsing static content, then contention would not be a problem; geo-replication and caching could handle most problems with skew. However, the reality is that interaction is key to these applications, so they must deal with real-world contention. Claret helps mitigate contention by allowing programmers to expose application-level concurrency through ADTs, which the datastore leverages in the transaction protocol and client library. Together, these optimizations lead to significant speedups for transactions in high contention scenarios, without hurting performance on lighter workloads, competitive with non-transactional performance.
