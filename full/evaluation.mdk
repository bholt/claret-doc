## Raw Operation Mix

~ Fig { #plot-rawmix caption="Performance of raw mix workload (50% read, zipf: 0.8) while increasing number of clients, plotted as throughput versus latency. We can see that boosting and phasing together acheive significantly higher throughput before reaching saturation. [todo: get combining into this plot (if I can make it work)]" }

~ Fig { #plot-zipf caption="Peak throughput with varying workload skew. Higher zipfian results in greater contention; abstract locks, used in boosting and phasing, perform better. Phasing alone is ineffetual." }

~ Fig { #plot-mix caption="Peak throughput, varying operation mix. For read-heavy workloads, using commutativity (boosting) is irrelevant, but with a greater fraction of commutative updates, reader/writer locking falls over while boosting maintains high throughput." }
