## RUBiS Auction Site

Though not part of the original specification for the RUBiS benchmark, studies measuring online auctions have shown that auctions also exhibit power-law properties as well [@menasce2007]. The number of bids per item is geometrically distributed: many auctions have very few bids, while a few have a very large number of bids. Furthermore, the frequency of bidding increases as an auction nears its close.
